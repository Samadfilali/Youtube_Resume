WEBVTT

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.960
okay so introducing Gro 3 we have two

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.240
new modes deep search and think so yeah

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.120
think is the reasoning model deep search

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.760
is probably what we have seen from both

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400
open Ai and Google with the Deep

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.240
research probably something similar

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.440
we're going to try out both of those

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.720
also let me show you a few things we're

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.039
going to test today so I'm just going to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.080
quickly switch over to that and then we

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320
come back to grock 3 and see what this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.720
model can do so these are the tests I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.640
want to run today on grock 3 the first

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.800
one is going to be a coding test we have

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.480
done a version of this before it's a PDF

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.760
PFD PDF Source extraction app where we

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.559
can put in a PDF extract all the URLs

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.480
and kind of follow those Down The Rabbit

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.160
Hole uh you will see this soon uh but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.800
today I want to add a challenge and that

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.760
is going to be to add like a visual node

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.079
spider web so we can follow this in like

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.719
a visual style too where we connect all

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.079
the sources uh or URLs to different

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.640
papers next I want to try the Deep sick

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.920
feature whoops API pricing recent event

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
tests deep search deep research uh we're

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.320
going to compare uh Gro 3's deep search

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.280
with perplexities deep research see that

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.400
how that goes if we get access to the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.240
reasoning model or the think feature

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.560
we're going to try it out Al some couple

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680
of puzzles we have here modified River

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.360
Crossing puzzle you would see that when

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.920
we get to it if I don't get access to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.320
this uh think feature in time before I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.119
want to publish this video we just going

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.759
to test it out on the the base model and

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.920
maybe come back to that so yeah let's

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.000
head over to GRS grock 3 on x and yeah

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.640
do a few tests on this okay so let's try

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.680
it so let's click here and you can see

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.719
we can now probably just refresh this I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.159
think and we are on the grock Tre beta

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.880
okay perfect okay so it says down here

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.719
uh our new feature deep search and think

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.719
will hit your interface soon stay tuned

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:57.880
okay so we're probably going to wait for

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
that uh but that means that we can start

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.759
with the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.920
coding uh so let's try that without the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.479
thinking part so here's what we're going

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.080
to do we're going to write an app that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.599
can run in my browser with the following

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
features uh upload a PDF and extract all

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.000
the URL sources found in this PDF in a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.120
nice structured list if I click the URL

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120
to a source download this Source extract

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.160
all the URLs from this and display this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.040
in a nested list so I can continue down

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.480
this Rabbit Hole of nested links and we

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.640
going to do a second challenge that is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.200
going to from this PDF create kind of a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.360
spider web of sources of URLs and we

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360
want to display this in like a topical

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.840
map with nodes so uh I'm just going to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.959
copy this uh let's go here paste this in

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.519
and let's run

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.319
it okay so that was pretty quick I got

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.040
to say I don't know if it's pretty fast

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.760
that's kind of my first

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.720
impression super

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.760
quick um um to use this okay so we need

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.760
a server yeah that's probably correct

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.360
okay interesting

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.599
interesting uh all right so yeah I'm

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.360
just going to copy this python code and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.319
HTML code and let's head over to cursor

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.400
and let's paste it in here right in it's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.080
HTML okay so let me upload this and find

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.640
a PDF we can test okay so let's open up

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.120
a PDF here yeah that looks pretty good

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.239
uh let's try this paper

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.599
right okay good that seems to work

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.200
pretty good so you can see we have some

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200
other links to other papers what if we

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.720
click on this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.439
now okay so we couldn't fetch that one

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.959
that's fine so we need probably some way

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.120
to download this uh that was pretty much

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.239
what I expected so let's try to fix that

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.840
write a new code with uh a server to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.000
work uh around of course something like

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.560
this let's try that so what I'm noticing

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.760
as it is pretty quick okay so you want

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.959
to do a node server here we have some

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.720
package.json

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.319
server.js okay uh so I'm going to try to

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.840
set this up and see if our Simple app

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.400
will work now and yeah first impression

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.600
this looks pretty good okay so we set

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
everything up we install this so let's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.520
do mpm start and open this in three

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.720
times ,000 mm start

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.400
3,000 okay good guess we open two let's

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.960
pick our file

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440
now and here's the moment so let's try

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.320
to download this PDF yes that worked so

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.320
now you can see we nested all the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.520
resources here uh I guess we can't close

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.840
it let's try this

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720
one okay here we have some open

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.160
AI uh okay so yeah I think that looks

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.840
pretty good we found all the resources

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.680
uh yeah pretty good uh next step is

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.080
going to be the next part of the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.759
challenge and that is going to

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.680
be to from uh this thing create a spider

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.479
web how resources are linked together

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.720
display this in a topical map with nodes

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.120
of each

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.960
source so I'm going to try to form this

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.880
prompt here and see if we can create

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.840
kind of a visual representation of all

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.199
these nested links right so let's just

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.520
try great that worked now let's expand

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.680
our app from a PDF we upload craw all

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.560
the URLs and create a spider web of how

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.560
sources URLs linked together and display

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.199
this in a topical map with nodes of each

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.240
source so this is going to be the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.720
challenge I haven't tried this before so

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.639
okay we need to open this uh yeah that's

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.560
fine so I'm going to

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.039
follow the instructions here here we get

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.160
again I kind of like the speed I think

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.120
that feels pretty good okay so I'm going

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.360
to implement this and let's try it out

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.720
and see if we can get this to work okay

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.639
so I updated the IM

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.919
index.html uh let's open up our host

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.560
again uh okay so we can see we have this

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.520
yeah box here let's find our

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.400
paper yeah that works right cool so now

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.199
we can kind of zoom in I guess there are

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.319
some UI work to do here but you can see

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.319
we have this uh different nodes here we

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.199
can click on

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.000
them uh okay so what happens if I click

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.400
on this now okay so we get a new node

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.360
yeah this is exactly what I wanted

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.720
because you can see the agent PDF points

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.840
to this

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.720
node and this uh node points to all the

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.639
links in this so if we click on

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.080
something else here let's click on yeah

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.520
I don't know let's just try something

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.639
this one okay so this one points to this

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.400
one yes this is exactly what I wanted so

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.199
this is kind of a topical map you can

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.599
follow along with all of the nodes here

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.080
right where they point so yeah I got to

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.080
say good job on this think is pretty

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.879
cool and a pretty smooth integration so

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.319
so far uh I've been pretty impressed by

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.000
the um coding here uh it's not the most

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.199
challenging thing but you have to get

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.720
everything right and yeah we kind of one

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.160
shot of this so so far so good after

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.240
waiting a few hours we now have access

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.240
to the Deep search feature uh and as you

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.159
can see we still don't have access to

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.599
the tink feature as I thought they

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.680
called it uh but let's try the Deep

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.000
search feature and we can compare it to

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.120
perplexity deep uh research

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.120
there's a lot of names here on this deep

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.520
search so I just have a few points I

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.479
want to try uh the first thing is going

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:10.960
to be find and list the API prices for

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.840
open AI 3 mini deeps R1 clo 3.5 and

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.120
Gemini 2.0 flash so let's just grab this

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.560
this is something I think it's helpful

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.919
okay so let's sure make sure we put this

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.960
on right and click on

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.639
this uh okay so this is a pretty inter

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.800
in UI you can see we have the sources

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.440
here uh we kind of go

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.880
through researching so it's browsing

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.440
open AI for o okay and we have some kind

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.599
of comments that didn't work maybe it's

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:43.760
not

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.959
accessible we are

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:49.000
searching all right pretty

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.680
interesting uh got to say kind of like

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.200
this UI it looks pretty good so we're

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.959
going to run the same query on um on

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:00.360
perplexity after to compared the two

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.720
results I

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.560
think and we can see down here we kind

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.880
of have the sources so we have 87 web

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.480
pages uh as sources now okay pretty

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.519
interesting okay we have completed uh do

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:18.200
we get the answer down here now open AI

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.040
1.10 440 that's correct deeps 55 to19

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.040
that's correct 315 that's correct Gemini

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.040
flash where did that go

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.000
I don't think this is correct I don't

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.959
think so let me quickly double check

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:36.839
that now as you can see it's much

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:40.480
cheaper than that it's like 10 in for

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.959
text and0 4 out so that was wrong but he

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.800
got three out of four correct okay

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.880
that's fine I guess we have some

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.399
citations here and yeah let me check

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:56.279
this that was a bit strange because we

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.399
got the

00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:00.440
correct yeah that was a bit strange

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.959
what price is

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.160
this Gemini 2 flash huh okay yeah that

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.000
was a bit strange uh other than that

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.880
yeah looks pretty good let's run the

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.880
same on perplexity okay so I ran it

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.160
through here here you can kind of see

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.240
the query uh this was very slow do we

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.800
get any information how long it took I

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.160
think it took about 5 minutes 50 45

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.440
sources uh sadly we ended up

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.120
with uh yeah we got two out of uh four

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.519
correct so open a I3 mini was horrible

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:44.480
200 million output that was yeah bad uh

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.880
it got deeps R1 correct it got clawed

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.959
correct but it didn't answer

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.880
flash so yeah I got to kind of give this

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.279
to Gro even though it didn't perform

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.079
perfect either it got three out of four

00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:01.200
and perplexity got two out of four uh

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.120
let's do one more query here on the

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.120
research uh thing let's do how do Gro

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.880
three rank on the llm benchmarks

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.480
compared to deep seek R1 and 03 mini let

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.639
me grab that put that in here and send

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:21.720
that uh let's do the same here new tread

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.800
deep

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.480
research and yeah least let see uh what

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.800
we get back here uh first impression is

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.560
that grock 3 is pretty

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.760
quick uh at least compared to deep

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.600
research you can see it's a bit slower

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.880
uh but I think for these deep research

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.560
models doesn't matter too much because

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.320
they are not a quick lookup you just

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.320
want to focus on getting a good answer

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.000
right so I don't think that's a deal

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.360
breaker the most important part is that

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560
the answer is as close

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.880
to as close to the correct answer as

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.440
possible so let's see uh the results

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.760
here okay so Gro is already finished so

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
it says Gro 3 ranks highest among deeps

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.200
r103 mini on General

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.760
benchmarks chatbot Arena lead board okay

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.600
uh O3 mini performs better while ranks

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.000
lower overall okay yeah kind of

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.760
inconclusive here okay so we didn't get

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.560
like a good conclusion here it's just

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.440
yeah uh O3 mini beats them in IM but if

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.399
you look at uh here you can say I24 here

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:37.399
you can see Gro 3 is a b uh deeps R1 and

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:40.360
O3 mini so yeah I think it got a bit

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.519
confused here I guess the only thing

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:45.480
that was correct was the chatbot Arena

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.600
leaderboard I saw somewhere that was on

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.440
top of that and deeps is still looking

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.800
here so we're just going to let that

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.160
finish okay so I've been waiting around

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.920
10 minutes here now 15 minutes and yeah

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.519
do look like we get an answer here from

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:04.560
uh perplexity so I just think we have to

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.160
call it so yeah not so good results on

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.040
this one if you ask me but uh at least

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.880
we got something here from Gro 3 I guess

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.000
okay so there been a lot of hours since

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.320
I first tested it since I got access and

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.240
I still don't have the thing feature

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.560
kind of wanted to publish this video

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.760
today so basically you're going to have

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.279
to skip that but let's try to run my my

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.839
altered River Crossing puzzle anyway

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:34.199
that was going to be the reasoning test

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:35.800
so the prompt we're going to run is the

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.000
following is a famous puzzle a man and a

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.320
goat are on one side of the river

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.880
there's a wolf and cabbage on the other

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.120
side the man has a boat the man wants to

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.639
get the goat to the other side of the

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:47.440
river how does he do that give a final

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.320
answer with a confidence score so the

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.480
idea behind this prompt is that uh this

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.680
has a lot of training data because this

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.480
is a famous puzzle and the famous puzzle

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.680
is a bit different you have to sh all

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.680
the Cabbage wolf and the man over in

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.279
like different alternate states to get

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.279
this complete but here we I kind of

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:10.240
changed it up so let's see if the model

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.519
can kind of break from the training data

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.839
that is the ID and solve this with the

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:18.160
information it has here so we had some

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.000
fun with this on my other model test so

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.560
it's basically a reasoning model or a

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.720
test time compute model test well let's

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.920
just try it here on Gro 3 and see what

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.800
kind of answer we get

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.320
so okay so it goes into this uh uh let's

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.839
break this down step by step

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:41.120
right uh the puzzle States one side of

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.839
river BL blah BL okay initially man side

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:47.839
a man go wolf cabbage

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.240
good uh okay that satisfies the goal

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.320
dust a straight forward solution the man

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.839
uses the boat to get the gooss final

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.040
answer the man gets into the boat with a

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.639
the goat and Rose across the river to

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.800
the other side delivering the goat there

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.800
95% perfect yeah that is the correct

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.639
answer so yeah pretty good uh we have

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:11.600
tried this on some other models before

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.639
and it didn't kind of solve it uh let's

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.199
spin up a couple of other models to see

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.759
kind of how this Compares now uh we can

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:23.199
do grock through first grock through gr

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:26.120
grock 2 and see what this says okay so

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.440
here you can see it falls into the

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.040
traper going into the previous data

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.440
because uh you can see it

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.839
situation uh it says here the man can

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:36.480
successfully transport a goat to The

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.319
Other Side by making three trips as

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:42.319
described above now it has to says T

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:44.800
third trip or three trips and I wrong

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.600
right because he can just take the the

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.920
goat on the other side right uh he

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.880
doesn't have to do multiple trips so the

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.480
man takes the Cabbage across to the

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.560
other side now the goat is alone yeah so

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.279
he goes into this typical trap here and

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:04.720
grock 2 does not answer this correctly

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.160
but grock 3 does so that's at least good

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.480
uh let's spin up some open AI models and

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.040
try this out so let's start on GPT 40

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.360
yeah this Falls in straight into the

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.399
Trap right uh it says goes back so it

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:22.199
five steps the man successfully gets the

00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:23.240
goat On The Other Side by first

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.160
seconding across performing a sequence

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.000
of trips so this Falls straight into the

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.800
Trap by look looking too much at the

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.279
training data and don't re kind of

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:35.360
consider what we are asking for here so

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.759
let's spin this up on 03 mini High

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.240
hopefully 03 mini solves this but let's

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.279
see final answer the Man simply puts the

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.759
goat into his boat roves across the

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:48.720
other side 100% perfect so yeah I kind

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.920
of noticed here in the reasoning that uh

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.720
this puzzle might be tricking me by

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.360
asking more complicated solution well

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.240
all that needed is for man just to take

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.120
the goat across it seems straightforward

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.480
but hm yeah uh so yeah it kind of got to

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.280
the perfect answer at the end here so

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.760
that was good at least uh but again we

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.319
saw that grock 3 could solve this pretty

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.959
easy even without the the thinking step

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:17.600
so yeah I guess that's pretty good and

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.160
yeah a shame we couldn't test out the

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.559
thinking part but uh other than that

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.559
yeah I think it was pretty pretty good

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.760
okay so that was basically all we had

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.720
today because we kind of tried out

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.120
everything I guess we skipped my

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.200
previous test since we don't have the

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.240
thinking features uh since we also don't

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.160
have the API I don't think uh we have

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.039
any update on live bench I kind of like

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:43.400
to look a bit at uh the live bench

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.799
coding average here and compare because

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.039
yeah I don't put too much effort or

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:52.039
thought about benchmarks anymore uh I

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:55.400
Saw The Benchmark results on Reddit or X

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.840
and they look pretty good for grock 3

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.400
and I saw Andre Cary put up a x post let

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.520
me see if I find it yeah he wrote a long

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.200
post here you can see I was giv Early

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.880
Access making me think uh one of the

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.520
first few uh who could try the quick wi

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.080
Shack who can run a quick wibe Shack so

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.640
his summary was like uh quick WIP check

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.360
two hours this morning uh feel somewhere

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.240
on the state of the art territory about

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.960
open AI strongest model 03 Pro 200 a

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.720
month so and slightly better and deeps

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.400
R1 and Gemini 2 flash2 Thinking yeah

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.240
that's pretty good I'm pretty impressed

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.440
by that uh shame I didn't get to try it

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.480
out but I'm definitely going to do that

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.360
later so yeah pretty positive results I

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.919
would say for Gro 3 uh at least getting

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.760
like uh some good words here from Andre

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.240
car party he's kind of the one of my

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.960
trusted resources when it comes to llms

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.720
and it's going to be fun to see when we

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.280
get the API what we can do with gr 3 so

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.280
yeah here's here's kind of his uh SVG of

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.760
a pelic and riding a bicycle that was

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.280
pretty funny so yeah kind of looking

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.480
forward to getting my hands on the API

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.120
other than that first

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.559
impressions uh we don't can't we can't

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.400
use it on gro.com yet but first

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.600
impressions uh pretty quick seems kind

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.799
of okay want to try out the tin feature

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.440
more than that so definitely go check it

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.280
out and you need a premium plus so I

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.679
would just wait until they have some

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:27.600
free models available soon and I guess

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.120
maybe I don't know EX exactly if you

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.520
need premium plus to try it out but uh

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.760
yeah look out for it uh so far I'm

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.880
pretty positive about this looks pretty

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.280
interesting so I'm going to maybe do

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.840
another video on it when we get access

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.440
to the API so yeah hope you learned

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.120
something hope it was pretty cool and

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.760
thank you for tuning in and we speak

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.159
soon
