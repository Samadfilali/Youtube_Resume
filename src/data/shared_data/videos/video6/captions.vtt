00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.279
hello Community we have here from

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.560
perplexity the new deep research engine

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.679
if you interested in science this will

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.840
go out for about three minutes time so

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.559
it's much faster than open the so let's

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.160
explore the performance here of per

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.080
plexity ey deep research so let's go

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320
with this you see I have a question want

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.000
to know the latest AI research on how to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.960
build an enrich complex knowledge graphs

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.119
with multi-agent system explain the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.279
challenge of multi- AI agents in context

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.480
with Knowledge Graph

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.239
de research comes here says I need to

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.760
search the web to find information on

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.719

multi-agent system and Knowledge Graph

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.360
as of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.400
2025 smos never heard of this AI Sutra

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.680
academic make oop okay never heard of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.760
those

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.480
before escargo really delicious yeah if

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.440
you in France or in Belgium yep so this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.200
is real time I've now got enough

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.959
information to answer your query provide

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.560
a comprehensive view of multi-agent

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.159
system useful knowledge qu enrichment

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.400
including Karma this is it all right

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.440
let's tackle the query yeah I need to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.080
pass the provided Search construction

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.760
enrichment I need to cover methods I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.120
structure the report I look at all the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.480
results I challenge the paper I need to

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.640
ensure that each section flows naturally

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.560
the US to mention this and we have the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.319
first commercial yeah beautiful and here

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.799
we have yep so as you can see on the top

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.599
you have here my query this is the

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.000
answer I just want to see here the speed

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.760
this is real time speed uh you don't

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.480
have to read we go through this in a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.640
second I just want to see here the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.400
speed there's no mathematical framework

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.879
at all there's

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.239
no science at all this is just okay

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.799
little bit of tax bullet points a little

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.879
bit of tax and bullet points oh we have

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.640
related this is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.840
nice how does karma handle domain

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.159
adapation enrichment specific task for

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.599
the karma framework platform cross agent

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.840
verification relability in karma nice it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.040
found the most outsanding paper that I

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.320
was interested in beautifully done so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.759
now I think okay graph enrichment to

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.600
collaborative verification now let's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.639
have a look at the answer because now we

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.840
will see if it is really worth it and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.039
here you see deep research you see it's

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.320
so easy to activate and we have five

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.400
tries per day in the free

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.880
version so let's have a look at the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.720
final answer here the official answer

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.240
you know this was here by this

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.800
particular Source then alive okay and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720
then here this particular Source I'm not

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.039
aware and out of 49 resources

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.360
interesting okay can we have a look at

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.560
this what happens if I click here oh

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.720
nice so I have here one paper I have

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.160
here two papers three papers ah another

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.039
llm yeah Power decentralized generative

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.320
agents

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.880
okay okay I don't know the sources

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.240
interesting data science Dojo whatever

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.720
another alive vocal Springs apps okay

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.360
but you need to know about multii agents

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.600
okay multiple

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.960
sources okay now this sounds interesting

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.360
here we are sorry about we experiencing

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.199
unusual traffic at a time please keep us

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.560
informed that you are not a robot and

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.000
you will take your

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.479
content could not validate capture

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.240
please try again okay so this Source

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.560
here tells us hey sorry bud you seem to

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.720
be a bot my yes reinforcement learning

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.960
open source multi-agent system LinkedIn

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.080
unbelievable nor lab

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.520
YouTube 30y LinkedIn 31 iple e okay

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.319
alive

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.599
alive

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.360
okay knowledge gr okay so it looks like

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.080
they really found a lot

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.120
of

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.000
okay so sources are clear beautiful

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.440
let's go now here to this one recent

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.039
prors and artificial intelligence have

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.759
to re a powerful Synergy between

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.160
knowledge gr architectures and

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
multi-agent system and a

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.479
unprecedented capabilities and automated

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.639
knowledge organization and reasoning

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.319
this report analyzes four pioneering

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.960
Frameworks 1 2 3 4 that demonstrate how

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.880
coordinated AI agent can overcome

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.400
traditional limitations in Knowledge

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.560
grth Management while confronting new

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.080
challenges in system coordination and

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.560
domain adaptation and I have here three

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.440
so the first one is

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.199
here eii Sutra okay the next one is here

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.360
uh okay arive and then we have here

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.919
arive what would happen if I click

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.120
here okay ah article by medium okay this

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.360
was November 4

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.639
2024 maybe not really the latest but

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.680
okay so Synergy between Knowledge Graph

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.080
and multi-agent

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.720
architecture modern knowledge gra

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.479
maintain consistence across distributed

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.720
knowledge update in Amazon

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.759
implementation the structured Foundation

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.280
yep

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.479
okay Karma framework

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.280
okay cutting age framework and Technical

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.120
Innovations Karma yeah

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.680
beautiful decentralized knowledge gra

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.039
evolution in open

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:45.919
worlds hierarchical knowledge

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.639
organization Dynamic relationship

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.080
okay core challenges and multi-agent

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.159
knowledge gra systems comma experiment

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.319
reveal yep

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.599
okay temporal consistencies

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.120
this is the framework here this is the

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.960
framework here comma framework requires

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.560
yep Omni pause system demonstrate

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.599
potential through this one

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:15.280
okay 2024 most powerful eii agent

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:22.159
papers okay yeah agent have become one

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:25.319
of the most popular trends of

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.759
2024 multi-agent system Amazon

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:33.919
horard finon this is

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.479
okay Omni porer click here to learn

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:41.159
more let's have a look we are here in

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.919
August of

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.519
2024 so maybe not really the latest

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.519
paper but okay future Direction and

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.640
unsolved problems neuros symbolic

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.360
integration for enhanced

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.800
reasoning unsupervised schema cross

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.440
domain human in the

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.760
loop machine yep verification so it got

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.519
one right yeah karma is really one of

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:09.480
the latest this is really nice so

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.440
okay nice 52 resources really nice so if

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.279
we go back here yes we get our

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.680
commercials back again yeah baby this is

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.800
it we have our commercials back ask a

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.480
follow-up question no

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.720
thanks I want to know the latest year

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.040
research on how to build an Rich

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.440
knowledge gra great now let's do the

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.880
next good

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.839
thing so let's

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:41.320
see edit the query no I want to know

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.000
yep edit the query deep research

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.320
interestingly that I lost here more or

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.839
less here the the

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:56.200
PA how this was discovered 52 oh no nice

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.640
so can I yep so I can go in here and see

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.839
the complete reasoning and also the

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:07.200
sources real nice real

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.560
nice

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.440
yep I need to ensure each section flows

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.600
naturally using header properly its

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.720
paragraph

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.560
should site the relevant sources when

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.640
discussing commer I to yeah also the

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.399
user mention explaining the challenges

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.360
of multi- Ag and in the context of

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.480
Knowledge Graph so after presenting the

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.279
framework a dedicated ated section on

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.760
challenges would be necessary the paper

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.240
mentions issues like schema alignment

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.760
verification conflict edges and

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.040
communication overhead I should avoid

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.160
lists and use narrative paragraphs this

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.560
is nice for example when I'm talking

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.560
about agents in karma describe the roles

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.279
in a flowing text rather than bullet

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.320
points ensure that each challenge is

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.880
explained and how the framework attempts

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.720
to solve them citing the sources

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.639
appropriately finally the conclusion

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.760
would synthesize how these Frameworks

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.120
address The Challenge and suggest

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.720
further directions

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.040
yep Caper it okay need to check all

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.320
points from the search results are

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.120
included that report is comprehensive

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.040
hitting around 10,000 words with deep

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.200
dives into each framework and challenge

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.160
make sure citations are correctly placed

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.440
after each relevant sentence writing the

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.399
research report yep absolutely

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.880
transparent I could now really go in and

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.720
say okay would like to have a look at

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.800
all my

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.600
sources those where the stabs this looks

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.240
really nice

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:33.800
so here we are ladies and gentlemen what

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.240
do you want to know provide a detailed

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.120
overview of the latest research insight

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.600
into self-learning AI what methods do

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.639
exist in recent time to improve here

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:45.120
self-learning and provide a context to

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.000
deep reasoning with models like deep

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.079
seek R1 estimate our latest technology

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:52.160
level of self-learning AI systems

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.320
including multi-agent system and their

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.399
mathematical Frameworks what do you

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.120
think let's try this out let's go with

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.959
it is in deep

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.639
research four enhanced quar is remaining

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:06.959
today this is beautiful this is all I

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.560
need to

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.120
know start by preparing a research plan

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.920
okay here you go baby here you

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.399
go deep research often takes a few

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:22.160
minutes to complete yes I notice take

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.680
your time my little one we have all the

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.160
time in the world I need to search for

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.320
recent research on self-learning AI get

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.040
information about advancements yes mcken

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.639
IBM data Camp oh wow

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.399
okay the previous search provided a

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:41.760
broad overview of enhancements in self

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.240
learning including agentic AI multimodal

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.920
capabilities o1 and Google German I 2

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.120
did not specifically address deep

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.959
o1 so we seek now we search now for deep

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:54.760
seek R1 self learning AI I need to

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.160
search for information on the latest

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.639
development yeah this includes our

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.600
interaction between agents model

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.360
particular Frameworks like Game Theory

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.240
control theory or other Advanced

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.199
mathematical approaches yes baby this is

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:07.000
it enable autonomous coordination and

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.480
learning multi-agent self learning AI

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.040
mock post the Apple developer magazine

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.440
the data scientist and one more okay

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.440
interesting we are reading now all these

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.519
articles valuable insight into the

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.360
multi-agent framework and ongoing Trends

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.680
in

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.480
multi-agents monola methodology aligned

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.480
with my hypothesis about mathematical

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.120
Frameworks like basan Frameworks and

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.560
actor critic methods I'm still uncertain

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.000
if all relevant Frameworks have been

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.399
comprehensively addressed to refine my

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.480
understanding I will now search for

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.480
additional academic articles or refs

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.600
that focus on the mathematical

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.040
foundations of self- learning in 2025

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.639
particular dose discussing deep

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:46.079
reasoning and multi-agent coordination

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.199
search term is self-learning AI systems

00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:49.760
deep reasoning I need to search for

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.720
detailed academic paper uh technical

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.680
paper specifically discussing deeps r

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.480
one reinforcement learning and its

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.000
implementation of chain of s reasoning n

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.920
not really

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.360
yeah multi-stage Pros they looking for

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.079
additional empirical evaluation

00:14:03.079 --> 00:14:04.720
technical breakdowns or case studies

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.399
deep seek R1 reinforcement learning

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.920
chain of sord paper oh no this this

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.560
could go

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560
wrong okay for dummies deep seek for

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.759
dummies maybe not the best title but

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:18.120
okay we're reading all those papers we

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.720
are getting all this information and

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.600
then we got comprehensive detail

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.279
information on deeps R1 multi-agent

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:26.199

collaboration Microsoft rstar matat yes

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:38.199
I have a video on this sensive data set

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:41.199
let's tackle the query okay

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:43.360
first I need to pause the research

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.120
results provided let's go through this

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.600
one search result two search result

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.320
three search result 4 now structuring

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.120
the report the user wants a scientific

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.560
Report with mandatory section evolution

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.920
of self leing and here we are we have

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.480
here a new commercial here we are lucky

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.279
today and a final ARs

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:09.079
here so yeah speed is okay

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.480
yes

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.000
okay hey yeah this is nice we get

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.519
something okay the typical aha moments

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:26.880
okay utility function not bad not bad my

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.440
little friend yep current Technologies

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.839
yeah we have a look at this in detail

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:35.240
don't mind never mind just want to see

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.000
okay now we are done so let's have a

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.839
look Al this was my query beautiful 36

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:45.519
sources here again we can see all the

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:48.360
steps that we went through avoid list

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.360
use narrative write a research report

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.240
ensure each paragraph flow so this is

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.600
the same that we already know current

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.240
tech level assessment let's have a look

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.519

rewrite I think I've done a quite a nice

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.679
job it is not an the structure I would

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:32.960
like to have it but it tried really hard

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.039
to do this so for a free version I have

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:40.600
to say really impressive absolutely

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.280
impressive where are my sources I want

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.840
to see my

introducing deep research by openi yep

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.320
arive arive arive YouTube

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.480
LinkedIn and this is it so interesting

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.559
it took videos it took would say here

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.520
particles from from different companies

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.960
it took here some academic

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.480
particles it took here some archive it

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.640
took here nice okay

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.919
yep not so bad not so

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:16.200
bad search videos no

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.400
thanks provide a detailed over you I

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.720
think it's really impressive so dare you

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.200
have it plexity ey deep research engine

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.039
real nice it only goes for 3 minutes not

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.440
like the 30 minutes that open ey does

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.360
but you know what for five free runs per

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.360
day this is a beautiful first go
