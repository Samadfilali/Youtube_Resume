00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.800
hello Community we're here back at

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.120
perplexity ey we here with deep research

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.599
and I want to show you what you should

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.639
be careful about what is working what is

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.880
not working and what might be a complete

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.560
failure if you use this the wrong way so

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.279
after 10 hours of playing around and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.600
trying to understand here the pro and

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.119
the cons this is my question I said hey

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.920
perplexity I deep research why the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.000
technical evaluation report and do this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.079
on yourself no do this here under

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.800
performance of deep research and I don't

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440
specify if it's Google if it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.440
perplexity or if it's openi deep

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.399
research for scientific insights from an

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.039
AI agent searching the internet and

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.559
arguing about the scientific findings

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.600
present in this report the pros and the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.680
cons of a deep research eii engine and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.760
why they might fail but fail not for the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.800
internal AI hallucination we all no this

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.480
not for oh for not for the missing dep

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320
of

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.680
reasoning but simply by the fact that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.600
the resources found on the internet are

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.840
not verified and not fact checked and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.320
you might say well of course but let's

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
see here if we let the system run for 3

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.479
minutes what are the inside by the eye

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.079
about itself no and the first surprise

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.600
here now you have to deep research you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.159
have 26 steps if you want to see them

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.479
here beautiful 26 sources here need to

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.759
search the app prev search provided here

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.560
Dept of everything we see here the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.159
Search terms we see here the Articles it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.399
found here MIT horard beautifully and we

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.799
can scroll down looking search results

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.360
here that describe deep research here by

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.960
the 03 model multistep beautiful user

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.479
wants a report to focus here on the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.520
failer points due to unverified sources

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.360
not the AI own hallucination and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.840
reasoning because we know they're

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.920
hallucinating and they know about

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.880
internal reasoning I just want to know

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.719
how it all comes together where is the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.680
source of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.399
information so I need to highlight how

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.480
even if the AI reasoning is correct if

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.720
the sources it uses are unreliable the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.040
output is flawed now this is now

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.480
following my polarization a little bit

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.560
too strong you see I don't want here

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.879
that you follow me

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.280
100% sometimes it produces incorrect

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280
facts despite structured a report and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.560
now let go so we we have here 23

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.440
resources so let's have 26 sources so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.599
I'm so sorry and here we go now before

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.760
we look at your answer just look here at

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.640
the text here we have now a paper here

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.239
technical evaluation and this is

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.840
beautiful but now do you notice do you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.280
spoty the first mistake it only focuses

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.560
here on open eyes deep

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.080
research and you want said why is it

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.920
ignoring itself it in itself DCI is deep

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.720
research and Google deep research was

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.000
even before

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680
openi well it simply goes and searches

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.879
the internet and what people wrote in

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.920
the internet what people responded on

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.680
the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.920
internet the more there is the more it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.640
will focus on this stuff so you have

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.840
here um clear polarization here on

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.120
quantity over quality is this true so

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.920
let's have a look so we go only for

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.599
opening eyes research but then this is

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.640
absolutely ons spot Source verification

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.120
challenge in the scientific inside

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.239
generation this is absolutely what I

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.879
wanted beautiful he got it 100% right

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.519
let's have a look at the technical

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.519
architecture and the workflow yes this

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.080
is what I wanted so breaking complex

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.519
question into subqueries yeah using your

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.040
o3s okay open eye 280 billion parameter

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.120
reasoning model and the source of this

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.519
and this is beautiful is here number one

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.360
number one is data

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.120
Camp let's have a look at data

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.840
Camp okay not familiar with this

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.360
internet resource February 5th

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.560
2025 a guide with practical examples so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.600
this was written here by Alex a data

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.519
science editor beautiful I don't know

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.359
this person but let's have a look at

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.520
this person what we know about is

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.040
nothing it's private I have no access to

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.840
this

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.560
person so our first source is somebody

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600
in the internet if you know him great

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.880
maybe it's a perfect great guy but I

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.919
cannot verify anything about this person

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.479
so the first statement here is by some

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.440
Source I'm not familiar with second

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.680
deploying 8 to 12 agent threat to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
simultaneously browse academic repost

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.919
this is great but then new sites and I

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.520
say uhoh you go with fox or go with CNN

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.680
and public

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.240
databases okay then cross referencing

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.160
beautiful so you wait this by the domain

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.360
Authority scores so I say okay open your

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.759
eye establish something like an

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.600
authority score for documents and then

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.680
you have a report synthesis generating

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.960
here the outputs beautiful and then the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.840
system prioritize coverage over coration

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.000
you see processing about 200 pages per

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.440
average research session with a 92

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.919
milliseconds per page analysis speed do

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.160
you believe this what is the source five

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.400
five is data Global Hub I don't know

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.560
this data Global Hub this is it this is

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.800
the link

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
here that I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.319
received do you believe this resource so

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.039
you might says hey you go there you find

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.120
it come on it's an article you just have

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.280
to invest yeah but I just go with the

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.160
link provided next one Benchmark

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.240
analysis I'm loving this you know you

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.479
only get one normally a benchmark

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.080
because you want to have this as a

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.639
marketing dominant Factor deep research

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.360
achieves 26% accuracy on Humanity's last

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.400
exam isn't this beautiful and then we

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280
have here something by the way this is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.199
from Source One and Only from Source One

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.319
and not other sources so we have one

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.039
source and this is it but even this one

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.840
seems to say I have to verify this now

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.319
error analysis

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.400
reveals that 38% of the incorrect

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.960
answers traced to outdated or retracted

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.599
studies cited as valid this is not what

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:45.919
you

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.680
want if you have here cited as valid

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.560
this this is definitely not what you

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.639
want and

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.479
40% this is not good then you have 22%

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.759
errors originating from non peer

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.199
reviewed prepr

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.840
treated as

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.639
authorative listen I know that allive

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.360
preprints are non authoritative okay if

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.080
you want to see this so more or less non

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.919
PR previewed but if you know the people

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.639
if you know the ORS maybe if you know

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.400
the institution or maybe just the head

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.960
of the department that is publishing

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.759
this I kind of know if I should trust

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.720
this or not if I encounter some complete

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.720
new article new ARS I just go into the

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.560
internet I know where they are at what

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.199
university at what laboratory I can

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.720
check them I see what they published

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.560
here I just have here this article and I

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.560
don't know if I trust them or

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.520
not yeah Flo data set from obscure repos

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.039
how should my L eye know what is a good

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:54.560
REO I understand that we have here

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.720
massive

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.159
mistakes Gaia Benchmark beautiful case

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:02.960
study case study by again this is Source

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.720
Number One Source number one

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.440
only CED 37 sources including eight pmet

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.159
articles three bioarchive PR prints and

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.400
16 manufacturing white

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.120
paper so I lit I went out on the

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.080
internet and found here from the

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.120
manufacturer here beautiful marketing

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.840
materials hey says H manufacturer our

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.680
product is the best product on the

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.800
market and of course the llm says Hey

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.839
wow I found some information about this

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:38.320
how gorgeous is it no oh yeah my little

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.159
poor

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.880
llm yeah the case study here failed to

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.680
flag conflicts of interest in 94% of

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.880
Industry sponsor

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.519
studies I understand how should this L I

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:55.920
know that certain persons or certain

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.440
institutes or certain

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.519
Institution are really the think tank of

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.399
certain industry

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:06.360
sectors a human might never look at this

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.360
and say hey this is the truth a human

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.240
might know about it and say hey this is

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.120
pure

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.279
marketing but how should a l eye do this

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:17.760
well there is a Formula but I show you

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.480
it is in a minute and then yeah for

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.000
example in this study they presented

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.560
here 2019 retracted nature paper as

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.880
current best

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.440
practice okay this this is this is not

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.760
really

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.560
great then we have the temporal decay in

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.760
Source relevance this is important if

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.560
you do academics so if we have here deep

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.360
research temporal awareness this is by

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.839
open ey here because we only looking at

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:49.519
Deep research by openi and our source is

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:54.200
again Source one so this is the master

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.240
Source here and thei is here referring

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.079
here primarily to One Source only a

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.560
person where we have no idea who this

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.920
person

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.480
is and they say hey temporal awareness

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.079
lags behind in the academic publishing

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:11.240
cycles for 2.3

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.959
years do you believe this I I can't

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:17.800
check this yeah maybe I if I go there

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.959
and I have a deep dive I would like to

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.120
have multiple sources if something is

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.519
stated to me here as a failer

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:31.000
mode okay next one Authority

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.560
misattribution okay yeah you might have

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.200
an Institutional bias you might

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.639
overweight the ivy league Affiliated

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:40.200
prence here you have yeah you have a

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.920
commercial influence here because 23% of

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.399
independent academic studies are traced

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:49.360
to Industry funded think tanks now what

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.320
a surprise so you see whatever there is

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.360
on the internet it is not the truth and

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.240
our little eye going out there hopeful

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.519
finding here correct scientific facts

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:05.920
comes back and yeah whatever they found

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.720
might be not what we are looking

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.240
for cross validation gaps I love this

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.600
parallel agent threats often Converge on

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.320
information Cascades rather than

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.920
conducting some real genuine

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.920
verification so what we have we just run

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.240
in Loops of multiple sources that

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.519
reference itself and therefore thei

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.560
thinks yeah this must be a true

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.360
information strength and limitation

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.160
beautiful okay 100 sources per report

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.200
versus human average of 12 yeah uh AI

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.399
with 100 Nvidia GPU can read reports

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:48.680
faster than any human can speed 11

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.560
minutes turnaround for task requiring

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.519
humans 3 hours absolutely believe in

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:57.040
this verification

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.000
shortcomings no crap test

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.480
integration and I said hey this sounds

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120
interesting no this this is not

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.200
something that I seem to like this is

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.720
one static credibility ristics because

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.880
the system seems to treat here

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.720
educational and governmental sources

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.399
under the internet as uniformly

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:21.480
reliable despite domain spoofing risks

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.600
or missing fact checking protocols might

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.320
say hey why meter said fact checking is

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.480
not necessary anymore well in science

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.120
you better do fact checking otherwise

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.279
you will be

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:37.720
surprised closed loop training yeah

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.800
reinforcement learning rewards citation

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.279
volume over quality this is what we know

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.920
and again we have Source number one

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.199
isn't this beautiful so when you do this

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:53.120
deep research here you see here inherent

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.160
limitation it's not wrong but how should

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.399
the I know how much the humans love on

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.959
the Internet technical enhancement and

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:04.160
this is no nice because now we do have a

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.000
formula integrate here a credibility

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.880
scoring system using your the modified

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.000
crab

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.440
criteria now this is beautiful they came

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.160
up with a formula where they say Hey

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.079
listen our credibility is a simple

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:20.199
numerical value and we have here 0.3 of

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.600
the authority Factor 0.25 of the

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.959
currency 0.2 of the relevance factor

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:30.040
0.15 of the accuracy we wait the

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.199
accuracy with

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:35.720
0.15 and then on the purpose we have

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.320
0.1 so okay I understand that they try

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.560
at least to somehow focus on relevance

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.000
accuracy on

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.199
purpose yeah they would partner here

00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:51.240
with other verification agencies but hey

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.120
who needs them anymore and then we have

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.320
a conclusion and I love this conclusion

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.360
look at this deep research revolutionary

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.519
literature synthesis and you say yeah

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:04.720
this is it yippe let's go and then deep

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.720
research inherits the vaps cacophony of

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.480
Truth and

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.800
misinformation and I think this is it

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.240
deep

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.839
research is based and of course it

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:20.560
inherits you the Reps cacaphony of Truth

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.759
and misinformation as published by us

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:28.320
humans as flooded here by Bots from

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.680
companies maybe from individuals maybe

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.240
from political groups that just share

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.279
misinformation and if you're an American

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.880
you might say hey we have to write a

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.959
free speech beautiful but this is what

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:43.519
you get back if you utilize your deep

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:46.759
research AI because this little AI has

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:50.759
no way of knowing here everything that a

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:53.360
human might know and yes you can

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.720
influence this little deep research AI

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.000
significantly so the path forward

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.959
requires tighter integration with

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:06.320
academic infrastructure and epistemic

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.720
humility gee I don't even know what this

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.600
means but recognizing that comprehensive

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.519
searching cannot compensate for

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:19.519
uncritical sourcing so you see Di is

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.199
aware of its own limitation and I kind

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:24.839
of loved this that we achieved this here

00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:28.000
with perplexity I and you see such a

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
simple question that I have here at the

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.440
beginning hey what's going on what is

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.680
happening

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.639
here and yeah you found here technical

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.399
evaluation of open ey's deep research

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.600
but please note this is not only open

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.519
eyi and yes I know in the next year's

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:46.480
open ey will improve significantly on

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.160
this Google will improve on this and uh

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.040
perplexity will improve on this and this

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.000
is why we need those things to be

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.759
available to us and even if it's five

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:59.680
tries a day that we as an open source

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.399
Community we can experience this we can

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.120
learn from the shortcomings we can

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.079
improve it we can learn and see what's

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:11.639
not working and if I only have open ey

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:14.120
deep research where I have to pay 200

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.240
bucks a month and I might not get here

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.720
such a beautiful Insight I don't like

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.920
this propietary closed systems for this

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.160
particular reason it doesn't enable the

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.720
community to learn to learn it together

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.519
because each and every person will see

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.160
different aspects we'll find out

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.560
different other data and therefore

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.519
putting it all together we can improve

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.920
the systems much

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.920
faster and yeah credibility of sources

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.519
we have 26 sources and you might say hey

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:51.040
great but do you know all 26 sources do

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.160
you know the people who wrote for these

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.959
26 sources you might s a block by Google

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:59.360
this is great I don't know I have to see

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.240
the ARs I have to read it I have to use

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.520
my experience that I have in the field

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.199
that I tell you hey I believe this and

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.199
then I go and I produce a YouTube video

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:13.439
and show my viewers and my subscribers

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:16.679
hey look I found something that I fact

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:18.880
check to the best of my knowledge I

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.839
think I know this people I know what

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.160
they published here in the past and they

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.439
have come up with some new ideas those

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.799
ideas are kind of in line with the

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:31.840
current EI resear search path with this

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.559
Avenue that we all encounter right now

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:38.840
so this is why I do a video for you so

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.360
you see this is interesting because it

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.440
brings me back here
