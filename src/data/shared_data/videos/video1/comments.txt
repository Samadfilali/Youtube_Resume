TTS is Text To Speech. Test Time Compute needs to be referred to as something less confusing.
When discussing new putative architectures for intelligent agents like TTS, I get the distinct impression of Matrochka dolls - infinite recursion into meta-meta-meta etc reasoning
It&#39;s pretty nice, i just wish the leading AI companies focused less on wasting their money on making products barely better than their previous interations and instead focuses all that money into research we&#39;d probably be making way faster progress than this ðŸ˜‚. The fact the efficiency decreases as the model size increases really says much about the inefficient nature of the current models. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be that hard to find out what makes biological neural networks so sample efficient...
IM curious about the research into the latent space structures, great video!
Was i the only one who read it rightðŸ˜‚
The next logical step is to perform TTS on top of your TTS trained LLM. Insert Xzibit meme
was looking for text to speech
LoL, same here
There&#39;s recent text to speech news as well, look up Zonos. Very small model that can clone voices and generate text in near real time on 4090. Linux/docker only at the moment.
I want something a lot better than whisper :(
LOL me too
Wonder if this does it work when context is &gt; 4k tokens?
